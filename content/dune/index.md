# Introduction

Dune is a masterpiece that gave us quotes like

> "Fear is the mind-killer"

and 

> "When is a gift not a gift?"

From the incredible world building to the edge of your seat journey of 
Paul's character arc, Dune is a champion of the fantasy world that will
always hold a place near my heart.
